# Packaging on Mac OS X

Packaging is supported on Mac OSX systems. Packaged executables will contain the entire PowerShell and .NET runtime so destination systems will not need either of these installed.&#x20;

## Prerequisites&#x20;

You will need to install the following in order to package on Mac OS X.

* [.NET Core SDK 3.1 or later](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/macos)
* [PowerShell 7 or later](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-macos?view=powershell-7.1)

Once you have them installed, you can setup your script for packaging.&#x20;

## Configuration

You will need to create a [Package.psd1](package.psd1) file in order to package. Here is an example configuration that will package the `test.ps1` script and output it to the `Downloads`You need to ensure that you set the .NET framework version to `netcoreapp31` and the platform to `osx-x64`.&#x20;

```
@{
    Root = '/Users/adamdriscoll/Downloads/test.ps1' # Root script to package. This is the main entry point for the package. 
    OutputPath = '/Users/adamdriscoll/Downloads/out' # The output directory for the packaging process. 
    Package = @{
        Enabled = $true # Whether to package as an executable. 
        DotNetVersion = 'netcoreapp31'
        PackageType = 'Console' # The type of executable to generate. Valid values are Service or Console. 
        PowerShellArguments = '' # Sets the arguments for the PowerShell process that is hosted within the executable. You can use arguments like -NoExit, -ExecutionPolicy and -NoProfile.
        Platform = 'x64' # Sets the architecture of the executable. Can be either 'x86' or 'x64'
        PowerShellVersion = '7.0.3' # You can specify Windows PowerShell or PowerShell 7 or later versions version (e.g. 7.0.0)
        RuntimeIdentifier = 'osx-x64' # You can specify other runtimes like linux-x64 (See .NET Core runtime identifiers)
    }
    Bundle = @{
        Enabled = $true # Whether to bundle multiple PS1s into a single PS1. Always enabled when Package is enabled. 
        Modules = $true # Whether to bundle modules into the package
    }
}
```

By default, some core modules are included. Additional modules will also be included when enabling the Modules bundle.&#x20;

## Running the Packager

You can run the packager by using the `Merge-Script` cmdlet of the PowerShell Pro Tools module. If you include the `-Verbose` flag, you will see output from the packaging process.&#x20;

In this example, we have a script named `test.ps1` with the following content.&#x20;

```
"Hello. I'm running on $($PSVersionTable.OS)"
```

You can install the PowerShell Pro Tools module and then run merge script against the package.psd1 file we created earlier.&#x20;

```
Install-Module PowerShellProTools
Merge-Script -ConfigFile ./package.psd1 -Verbose

After the packaging process is done, you can run your executable.&#x20;
